I'm Qi Luo, a Ph.D. student in the School of Computational Science and Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, advised by [Prof. Florian Sch√§fer](https://f-t-s.github.io/). My research focuses on the intersection of machine learning and numerical computation. 

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I graduated from Emory University with highest honors in Applied Mathematics, where I was advised by [Prof. Yuanzhe Xi](https://www.math.emory.edu/~yxi26/).
